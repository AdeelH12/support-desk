# 🎟️ Ticketing System (React)

The Ticketing System is a React-based issue tracking application that simulates real-world support workflows. Users can log in, create tickets, update their status, and view them across different pages. The project demonstrates routing, reusable components, and a modular structure for scalability.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Implement a real backend (Node.js + database such as MongoDB or Firebase).
- Add role-based authentication (admin, user, support agent).
- Introduce ticket categories & priorities for better filtering.
- Add search and sort functionality.
- Improve UI/UX with a modern styling library (Tailwind CSS or Material UI).

## 📚 What I Learned

- Building a multi-page app using React Router.
- Managing authentication logic in React.
- Structuring reusable and modular React components.
- Simulating real-world ticketing workflows in a front-end project.
- Planning for scalability and future backend integration.
